Cora, an elderly woman walked into her local St Michael's Church. The friendly usher greeted her at the door and helped her up the flight of steps, "Where would you like to sit?" he asked politely. "The front row please," Cora answered amiably. "You really don't want to do that," the usher said, "This vicar is really boring." "Sonny, do you happen to know who I am?" Cora inquired, looking directly at him. "No." he rejoined. "I'm the vicar's mother," Cora announced indignantly. "Do you know who I am?" he asked. "No," she said. "Good," he answered and disappeared.

The well respected PC Magazine published an article by 'A.C. Feafunnoll' on April Fool's Day 2005. It stated that: 'The federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and National Science Foundation (NSF) have issued a stunning joint announcement: PC viruses, worms, and spyware can now be transmitted via human contact. Researchers at St. Paul's College in Virginia have isolated roughly 100 cases of systems infected by human contact, the two agencies said at a press conference at NSF headquarters in Arlington, Virginia... One researcher, Avril Hidokwon, said she investigated a case where the Netsky.P virus spread to 10 systems by sneezing. The story then gave a link: 'For instructions on how you can decontaminate yourself and your PC and also avoid infection.' This URL took gullible readers to an April Fool announcement.

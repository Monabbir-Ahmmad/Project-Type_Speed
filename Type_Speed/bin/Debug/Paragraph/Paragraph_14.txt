HOW TO MAKE MILK TEA:
1. Add a teabag to your favorite cup.
2. Boil water and pour it over the teabag.
3. Wait 3 to 5 minutes for the tea to brew, without stirring or squeezing the teabag.
4. Remove the teabag and pour in a dash of milk. Note: milk should act as a flavor-enhancer, so you only need enough to add creaminess. Too much milk will mask the taste of the tea. Judge it by the change color as you add the milk and aim for an even shade - a very pale brown means you've probably poured in too much.
5. Stir with a spoon to blend evenly.

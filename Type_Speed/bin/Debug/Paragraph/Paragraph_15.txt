HOW TO MAKE THE PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE:
1. Use cold filtered water (if you don't like drinking your home water, don't make coffee with it)
2. Measure your coffee- use 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for every 6 ounces of water (usually one cup on your brewer)
3. Water temperature needs to be between 195 degrees â€“ 205 degrees. If you boil water let it sit for 30 seconds before using it (water boils at 212 degrees which is a little too hot to brew coffee)
4. Rinse your filter with hot water before brewing. Use a good quality oxygen bleached filter.
5. Pour just enough water over the grounds (wet not saturated) to let them bloom (they get puffy). After 30-45 seconds continue the pour over. This will get the most flavor from your coffee.
6. Drink your freshly brewed coffee within 30 minutes of brewing. Don't let coffee sit in a brewer all day long. Make it as you need it.

Before God created Adam, He ordered the archangels to bring seven handful of soil from Earth, in different colors, hence the different skin colors. But the earth sought the refuge of God, thus the earth will not be distorted. Only Azrail succeeded, due to seeking the refuge of God, for he did not return with empty hands like the other archangels before. Azrail took dust from different parts of the earth, so that his children might have different skin colors. When God informed the angels that he was going to put a successor on Earth, they questioned whether the human would cause bloodshed and damage, but He told them that He knew what they know not and taught Adam the names and commanded him to call them. When the angels failed to call the names, Adam called out the names. When God called to prostrate to Adam they all obeyed, except Iblis. He said, "I am made from fire when Adam is made from clay. I am better than him. I am not going to prostrate before him."
